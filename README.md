<h4>AES Block Cipher</h4>

<p>AES-dust is a compact Implementation of the AES block cipher with support for 128 and 256-bit keys. The modes of encryption supported are Counter (CTR) and Electronic Code Book (ECB).</p>

<p>All code is intentionally optimized for size rather than speed making it suitable for resource constrained environments.</p>

<h4>Files</h4>

<p>All files with .s and .asm extensions are compatible with the GNU assembler (GAS) except for the files in the MSVC folder that will assemble with either NASM or YASM.</p>

<h4>Side channel attacks</h4>

<p>AES was never intended to be resistant against side channel attacks. However, if you decide to use this code for an embedded project that requires a high level of security, first evaluate whether the code is sufficient against such attacks before including in your project.</p>

<h4>Licensing information</h4>

<p>Initially this was published with a BSD license. I decided to unlicense hoping more people would use and provide useful feedback.</p>
